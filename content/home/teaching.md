In the summer of 2016, I taught a Masters seminar on Semantic Parsing
(my thesis topic) at the University of Stuttgart. The slides and
course materials can be found [**here**](https://www.krichardson.me/files/stuttgart_course.zip)


Some random **notes and musings**: [**Number Theory Meets Computability
Theory**](https://www.krichardson.me/files/h10.pdf) (see also
[*blog post*](https://www.krichardson.me/post/number_computability/)). **Recent
Talks** (see also below): Brief (10 minute introduction) to
[**Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Language Modeling**](https://www.krichardson.me/files/nlu_lm.pdf) (*intended for a non-technical audience*); Overview of my recent
work on [**diagnostic testing of neural models**](https://www.krichardson.me/files/probing.pdf).
